## 1. Verified Properties

### 1.1 TLA+ Model Checking (6 specifications, 34 safety + 8 liveness)

Model checked by TLC with exhaustive state space exploration within declared
bounds. Properties hold for all reachable states within the model.

#### Policy Engine (MCPPolicyEngine.tla)

```
PROPERTY: S1 — Fail-Closed Default
MEANING:  When no policy matches an action, the verdict is always Deny.
          An attacker cannot find an input that produces Allow without
          a matching Allow policy.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPPolicyEngine.tla, InvariantS1_FailClosed)
          Verus (verified_core.rs, V1 + V2 — ALL inputs, deductive)
          Lean 4 (FailClosed.lean, s1_empty_policies_deny, s1_no_match_implies_deny)
          Coq (FailClosed.v, s1_empty_policies_deny, s1_no_match_implies_deny)
          Kani (proof_fail_closed_no_match_produces_deny, proof_verdict_deny_on_error, proof_compute_verdict_fail_closed_empty)
SCOPE:    TLA+/Lean/Coq prove the property on abstract models with parameterized
          matching predicates. Verus proves it on the actual Rust verdict function
          for ALL possible inputs (deductive, no bounds). Kani proves it on
          actual Rust code with empty policy sets and error paths.
TRUST:    The correspondence between abstract matching predicates and the Rust
          implementation's glob/regex/exact matching is tested (10,200+ tests,
          24 fuzz targets) but not formally proven. The Verus proof closes the
          gap for the core verdict computation — it operates on actual Rust code.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs, vellaveto-engine/src/verified_core.rs
```

```
PROPERTY: S2 — Priority Ordering
MEANING:  A higher-priority policy's verdict takes precedence over all
          lower-priority policies. The engine never skips a higher-priority
          match to apply a lower-priority one.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPPolicyEngine.tla, InvariantS2_PriorityOrder)
SCOPE:    Abstract model with integer priorities and 3 policies.
TRUST:    Rust sort_by implementation correctly orders policies by
          (priority desc, deny-first, id tiebreak). Covered by unit tests.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs (sort_policies)
```

```
PROPERTY: S3 — Blocked Paths Override Allowed
MEANING:  A blocked path rule produces Deny even if the policy's base
          verdict is Allow.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPPolicyEngine.tla, InvariantS3_BlockedPathOverride)
SCOPE:    Abstract model with path matching predicate.
TRUST:    Glob/regex path matching correctness (fuzzed, not proven).
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs (check_path_rules)
```

```
PROPERTY: S4 — Blocked Domains Override Allowed
MEANING:  A blocked domain rule produces Deny even if the policy's base
          verdict is Allow.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPPolicyEngine.tla, InvariantS4_BlockedDomainOverride)
SCOPE:    Abstract model with domain matching predicate.
TRUST:    IDNA normalization, punycode handling (tested, not proven).
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs (check_network_rules)
```

```
PROPERTY: S5 — Allow Requires Matching Allow Policy
MEANING:  The verdict Allow is never produced without an explicit matching
          Allow policy. There is no implicit allow path.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPPolicyEngine.tla, InvariantS5_AllowRequiresMatch)
          Verus (verified_core.rs, V3 — ALL inputs, deductive)
          Lean 4 (FailClosed.lean, s5_allow_requires_matching_allow)
          Coq (FailClosed.v, s5_allow_requires_matching_allow)
          Kani (proof_compute_verdict_allow_requires_match)
SCOPE:    Proven unconditionally on abstract models (TLA+/Lean/Coq).
          Verus proves it on actual Rust code for ALL inputs. Kani
          proves it on actual Rust code within bounds.
TRUST:    Same as S1.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs, vellaveto-engine/src/verified_core.rs
```

```
PROPERTY: S6 — Missing Context Produces Deny
MEANING:  When required evaluation context is missing, the verdict is Deny.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPPolicyEngine.tla, InvariantS6_MissingContextDeny)
SCOPE:    Abstract model.
TRUST:    Rust implementation correctly propagates missing context errors.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs (context_check)
```

#### ABAC Combining (AbacForbidOverrides.tla)

```
PROPERTY: S7 — ABAC Forbid Dominance
MEANING:  If any ABAC constraint evaluates to Forbid, the combined result
          is Deny regardless of any Permit constraints.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (AbacForbidOverrides.tla, InvariantS7_ForbidDominance)
          Lean 4 (AbacForbidOverride.lean)
          Coq (AbacForbidOverride.v)
          Alloy (AbacForbidOverride.als)
          Kani (proof_abac_forbid_dominance)
SCOPE:    Proven unconditionally across all tools.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/abac.rs
```

```
PROPERTY: S8 — Forbid Ignores Priority
MEANING:  A low-priority Forbid overrides a high-priority Permit.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (AbacForbidOverrides.tla, InvariantS8)
          Alloy (AbacForbidOverride.als)
SCOPE:    Abstract model.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/abac.rs
```

```
PROPERTY: S9 — Permit Requires No Forbid
MEANING:  A Permit result is only produced when no Forbid constraint exists.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (AbacForbidOverrides.tla, InvariantS9)
          Lean 4, Coq, Alloy
SCOPE:    Proven unconditionally.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/abac.rs
```

```
PROPERTY: S10 — No Match Produces NoMatch
MEANING:  When no ABAC constraint matches, the result is NoMatch (not
          implicit Permit or Deny).
TOOLS:    TLA+ (AbacForbidOverrides.tla, InvariantS10)
          Lean 4, Coq, Alloy
          Kani (proof_abac_no_match_produces_nomatch)
SCOPE:    Proven unconditionally.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/abac.rs
```

#### Capability Delegation (CapabilityDelegation.tla)

```
PROPERTY: S11-S16 — Monotonic Attenuation
MEANING:  Delegated capabilities can only be restricted (attenuated), never
          expanded. Depth is bounded. Temporal constraints are monotonic.
          Issuer chain integrity is maintained. Terminal tokens cannot delegate.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (CapabilityDelegation.tla, D1-D5, DL1)
          Lean 4 (CapabilityDelegation.lean, 15 theorems)
          Coq (CapabilityDelegation.v, 6 theorems)
          Alloy (CapabilityDelegation.als, 6 assertions)
SCOPE:    Proven unconditionally on abstract models.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-mcp/src/capability_token.rs
```

#### Cascading Failure (CascadingFailure.tla)

```
PROPERTY: C1-C5 — Circuit Breaker Safety
MEANING:  Chain depth is bounded. Error threshold triggers open state.
          Open circuit denies all requests. Half-open is transient.
          Probe success closes the circuit.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (CascadingFailure.tla, 5 invariants, 2 liveness)
          Coq (CircuitBreaker.v, 7 theorems)
SCOPE:    Model checked with bounded counters.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/cascading.rs
```

#### Task Lifecycle (MCPTaskLifecycle.tla)

```
PROPERTY: T1-T5 — State Machine Safety
MEANING:  Terminal states are absorbing. Initial state is valid. Policy
          is evaluated before transitions. Terminal tasks are audited.
          Bounded concurrency.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (MCPTaskLifecycle.tla, 5 invariants, 2 liveness)
          Coq (TaskLifecycle.v, 9 theorems)
SCOPE:    Model checked.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-mcp/src/task_state.rs
```

#### Workflow Constraints (WorkflowConstraint.tla)

```
PROPERTY: WF1-WF4 — DAG Validity
MEANING:  Workflow predecessor constraints are satisfied. DAG is acyclic.
TOOLS:    TLA+ (WorkflowConstraint.tla, 2 invariants)
SCOPE:    Model checked.
MAPS TO:  vellaveto-engine/src/lib.rs (workflow constraint evaluation)

| FailClosed.v | s1_empty_policies_deny, s5_allow_requires_matching_allow |

### 1.5 Verus Deductive Verification (40 verified items on actual Rust, 0 trusted assumptions)

Verus proves properties on the actual Rust code via Z3 SMT solving. Unlike
bounded model checking, Verus proofs hold for ALL possible inputs — no bounds,
no sampling. The verified code compiles with standard rustc after Verus erases
ghost annotations. The proof applies to the binary.

#### Core Verdict (V1-V8, V11-V12, 12 verified)

| ID | Property | Postcondition |
|----|----------|--------------|
| V1 | Fail-closed empty | `len() == 0 ==> Deny` |
| V2 | Fail-closed no match | All `!matched` → Deny |
| V3 | Allow requires match | `Allow` → ∃ matching Allow with no override |
| V4 | Rule override forces Deny | Path/network/IP override → Deny |
| V5 | Totality | Function always terminates |
| V6 | Priority ordering | Higher-priority wins (requires `is_sorted`). Compositional*: Kani K18 proves sort, Verus proves first-match-wins given sorted input. NOT individually postconditioned in Verus. |
| V7 | Deny-dominance at equal priority | Deny beats Allow (requires `is_sorted`). Compositional*: same as V6. |
| V8 | Conditional pass-through | Unfired condition → evaluation continues |

Source: `formal/verus/verified_core.rs` → `vellaveto-engine/src/verified_core.rs`

**Refinement gap:** Production code does NOT call `compute_verdict` on the hot
path. Instead, `PolicyEngine::evaluate_action` inlines structurally equivalent
logic that also handles context conditions, policy compilation, and ABAC
evaluation. The Verus-verified `compute_verdict` operates on pre-resolved
`ResolvedMatch` entries; production constructs these entries inline.
Equivalence is verified by `debug_assert_verified_*` spot-checks (debug builds
only) and 10,200+ unit/integration tests — not by a formal refinement proof.

#### Cross-Call DLP (D1-D6, 14 verified)

| ID | Property | Meaning |
|----|----------|---------|
| D1 | UTF-8 boundary safety | `extract_tail` never returns start in mid-character |
| D2 | Buffer size bounded | Extracted tail ≤ `max_size` bytes |
| D3 | Byte accounting correct | `update_total_bytes` maintains consistency |
| D4 | Capacity fail-closed | At `max_fields`, `can_track_field` returns false |
| D5 | No arithmetic underflow | Saturating subtraction prevents wrapping |
| D6 | Overlap completeness | Secret ≤ 2 × overlap split at `split_point ≤ overlap_size` fully covered (first fragment must fit in tail buffer) |

Source: `formal/verus/verified_dlp_core.rs` → `vellaveto-mcp/src/inspection/verified_dlp_core.rs`

#### Path Normalization (V9-V10)

| ID | Property | Meaning |
|----|----------|---------|
| V9 | Idempotence | Fully proved: normalizing a normalized path is a no-op |
| V10 | No traversal | Fully proved: normalized output never contains `..` component |

Source: `formal/verus/verified_path.rs`
Current local Verus output: `verification results:: 30 verified, 0 errors`.
Path idempotence is also independently proved in Lean, Coq, and Kani.

#### Rule Override Correctness (V11-V12)

| ID | Property | Meaning |
|----|----------|---------|
| V11 | Path block → Deny | Path rule override at any position with all prior Continue → final Deny |
| V12 | Network block → Deny | Network rule override at any position with all prior Continue → final Deny |

## 3. Abstraction Boundaries

Every place where a formal model simplifies production code.

| Abstraction | Model | Production | Impact |
|-------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Pattern matching** | `matchesAction : Policy → Action → Bool` | Glob, regex, exact, prefix, suffix, infix wildcards with NFKC + homoglyph + leetspeak normalization | Model cannot detect matching bugs. Mitigated by 24 fuzz targets. |
| **Context conditions** | Single boolean predicate | 17 condition types (time window, call limit, agent match, circuit breaker, etc.) | Model proves condition-gated policies work. Individual condition correctness tested. |
| **ABAC attributes** | Abstract predicates | Entity store with group expansion, Cedar-style evaluation | Attribute resolution correctness tested, not proven. |
| **Policy sorting** | `SortedByPriority` operator | `sort_by` with three-level comparator (priority desc, deny-first, ID tiebreak) | Kani K18 proves sort produces `is_sorted` output (bounded). Verus V6/V7 prove verdict correct given sorted input (ALL inputs). |
| **String operations** | Not modeled | NFKC normalization, homoglyph mapping, case folding, percent-decode | All tested and fuzzed. Not formally verified. |
| **HashMap/collections** | Not modeled | `HashMap<String, T>` for tool index, policy lookup, DLP buffers | Correctness relies on Rust standard library. |
| **Concurrency** | Not modeled | `RwLock`, `Mutex`, atomics with `SeqCst` ordering | Engine core is synchronous. Concurrency in audit, DLP, cluster. |
| **Network I/O** | Not modeled | DNS resolution, TLS handshake, HTTP/WebSocket/gRPC transport | Outside formal verification scope. |
| **Verus `&Vec<T>` vs production `&[T]`** | Verus uses `&Vec<ResolvedMatch>` | Production uses `&[ResolvedMatch]` (slice) | Semantically equivalent for read-only iteration. Verus requires owned containers for some spec functions. |
| **Syntactic divergences** | Verus/Kani may use `len() == 0` | Production uses `.is_empty()` | Semantically equivalent. Also applies to `saturating_sub` vs explicit `if a > b { a - b } else { 0 }`. |

### Sound Over-Approximations

The Alloy model uses set identity for path/domain subset checking rather than
glob matching. This is more restrictive than the Rust implementation — the model
may reject inputs that the implementation would accept, but never the reverse.
This is the security-safe direction: the model over-denies.

## 4. Unverified Properties

These properties are intentionally NOT formally verified. Each has a rationale.

| Property | Why Not Verified | Mitigation |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Side channels** (timing, cache) | Not modelable in current tools | Constant-time comparison in crypto paths (`subtle` crate) |
| **Availability / DoS** | Not modelable (resource exhaustion) | Rate limits, JSON depth/size bounds (MAX_SCAN_DEPTH=10), regex timeout, request body size limits |
| **Pattern completeness** (injection scanner) | Inherently open-ended (175+ patterns, evolving threat landscape) | 24 fuzz targets, encoding invariance tests, threat intelligence updates |
| **Distributed consensus** (cluster mode) | Redis-backed, single-writer per session | Not a consensus problem; Redis guarantees tested empirically |
| **Async Rust** | Unsupported by Verus, Kani, and all Rust verification tools | Engine core is synchronous by design. Async only in I/O layers. |
| **Compiled/legacy path equivalence** | Two evaluation paths should produce identical verdicts | Production inlines structurally equivalent logic rather than calling `compute_verdict` directly. Equivalence verified by `debug_assert_verified_*` checks (debug builds) and 10,200+ unit tests. |
| **Glob/regex compilation correctness** | Complex interaction of glob library + Unicode normalization | 24 fuzz targets + 200+ unit tests. Glob library widely deployed. |
| **Injection scanner recall** | Cannot prove "all injections detected" | Defense-in-depth: multiple detection layers, encoding normalization |
| **`ResolvedMatch` construction** | Production builds `ResolvedMatch` entries inline (not via `compute_verdict`). Phase 9 (K46-K48) formally verifies the inline decision tree produces equivalent verdicts. Remaining gap: ABAC evaluation and context condition evaluation produce booleans fed into the decision tree — these are not individually verified but covered by 10,200+ tests. |
| **`compute_overlap_region_size` / `overlap_covers_secret`** | Helper functions for DLP overlap analysis not in Verus | Covered by Kani K21 (bounded) and K22 (saturating). Verus proves the core `overlap_completeness_lemma` (D6) but not these wrappers. |
| **SDK payload conformance** | 4 SDKs (Python/TypeScript/Go/Java) must match server format | SDK-specific test suites. Not formally linked to server types. |

## 5. Verification Tool Trust

Every tool in the verification stack is itself part of the TCB.

| Tool | Version | What We Trust | Basis for Trust |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **TLC** (TLA+ model checker) | 1.8.0 | Exhaustive state exploration within declared bounds | 25+ years at AWS, Microsoft, Intel. Lamport's tool. |
| **Alloy Analyzer** | 6.x | Bounded relational model checking via SAT | 20+ years of academic use, SAT-solver backed |
| **Lean 4 kernel** | Current stable | Type checking and proof verification | Small trusted kernel (~10K LOC), community-audited, Mathlib |
| **Coq kernel** | System package | Type checking and proof verification | 40+ years, CompCert, seL4 |
| **CBMC** (via Kani) | Current stable | Bounded model checking of LLVM IR | 20+ years, AWS Firecracker verification |
| **Kani** | Current stable | Translation from Rust to CBMC | AWS-maintained, open-source, growing adoption |
| **Z3** (via Verus) | 4.13.x | SMT solving for Verus specs | Microsoft Research, most widely deployed SMT solver |
| **Verus** | 0.2026.03.01 | Translation from Rust+specs to Z3 queries | OOPSLA 2023, two best papers OSDI 2024, active development |

### Tool Independence

The verification stack uses multiple independent tools as defense-in-depth:
- TLA+ (TLC) and Alloy (SAT) use different solving backends
- Lean 4 and Coq use independent type theory kernels
- Kani (CBMC) operates on actual Rust via LLVM IR, not a model

A bug in one tool is unlikely to produce the same false positive in another.

## 6. CI Enforcement

Formal verification runs in CI via `.github/workflows/formal-verification.yml`.

| Job | Tool | Timeout | Trigger |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `tla-plus` | TLC 1.8.0 (Java 21) | 30 min | Push/PR to `formal/**`, `vellaveto-engine/src/**`, `vellaveto-mcp/src/inspection/**`, weekly Monday 6:00 UTC |
| `lean` | Lean 4 (elan) | 30 min | Same |
| `coq` | Coq (apt package) | 30 min | Same |
| `kani` | cargo-kani (CBMC) | 45 min | Same |
| `verus` | Verus 0.2026.03.01 (Z3) | 30 min | Same |

### Integrity Checks

- **No sorry (Lean):** CI greps for `sorry` markers — any found = hard failure
- **No Admitted (Coq):** CI greps for `Admitted` markers — any found = hard failure
- **All harnesses pass (Kani):** Every harness must report `SUCCESSFUL`
- **Code sync (Kani):** CI runs 9 production-parity unit tests verifying extracted code matches production behavior (identical test vectors, identical expected results)
- **All specs checked (TLA+):** All 6 specifications run through TLC
- **Verus verification (Verus):** Both `verified_core.rs` and `verified_dlp_core.rs` must report 0 errors

### Planned CI Additions (Phase 0+)

PR-level gating on security-critical paths will be added for:
- `vellaveto-engine/src/**` → Kani harnesses must pass
- `vellaveto-mcp/src/inspection/**` → Kani harnesses must pass
- `vellaveto-tls/src/**` → Kani harnesses must pass (Phase 3)
- `formal/**` → All verification jobs must pass

## 8. Roadmap

Phases 0–72 are complete. The TCB includes 523 Verus-verified items on actual
Rust code (deductive, ALL inputs via Z3 SMT), 82 Kani bounded model checking
harnesses, and comprehensive coverage of all security-critical pure functions.

| Phase | Status | What Changed | Properties Added |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Phase 0** (TCB + CI) | **Complete** | TCB document, CI workflow gating all 7 tools | Documentation baseline |
| **Phase 1** (Verus core) | **Complete** | Verus-verified verdict computation on actual Rust | V1-V8: fail-closed, priority, deny-dominance for ALL inputs |
| **Phase 2** (Verus DLP) | **Complete** | Verus-verified DLP buffer arithmetic on actual Rust | D1-D6: UTF-8 safety, overlap completeness for ALL inputs |
| **Phase 3** (Kani expansion) | **Complete** | 25 Kani harnesses (9 original + 16 new Verus bridge) | K10-K25: sort, ABAC, DLP, edge cases |
| **Phase 5** (IP verification) | **Complete** | IP address private/reserved detection (DNS rebinding/SSRF defense) | K26-K32: loopback, RFC 1918, CGNAT, IPv4/IPv6 parity, Teredo XOR |
| **Phase 6** (Cache safety) | **Complete** | Cache key safety, cacheability, staleness | K33-K35: session state isolation, case-insensitive keys, TTL/generation |
| **Phase 7** (Capability delegation) | **Complete** | Grant subset, glob match, path normalization on actual Rust | K36-K40: reflexive, no-escalation, pattern subset, glob universal, no-traversal |
| **Phase 8** (Rule checking) | **Complete** | Path/network/IP rule decision predicates | K41-K45: allowlist, blocklist priority, IDNA fail-closed, IP fail-closed |
| **Phase 9** (ResolvedMatch equivalence) | **Complete** | Inline vs verified verdict path equivalence | K46-K48: path/context deny, full equivalence proof |
| **Phase 10** (Cascading failure) | **Complete** | Circuit breaker config/capacity/error rate | K49-K52: NaN rejection, saturating depth, capacity fail-closed, rate bounds |
| **Phase 11** (Constraint evaluation) | **Complete** | Constraint skip detection, forbidden params | K53-K55: all-skipped, forbidden deny, require_approval propagation |
| **Phase 12** (Task lifecycle) | **Complete** | Task state machine on actual Rust | K56-K58: terminal immutability, capacity, cancel authorization |
| **Phase 13** (Verus path normalization) | **Complete** | Byte-level path normalization idempotence + no-traversal proof | 30 verified items; no trusted assumptions |
| **Phase 14** (Verus rule override) | **Complete** | Path/network block → Deny in final verdict | V11-V12: rule override correctness |
| **Gap closure** (IDNA/Unicode/Lock) | **Complete** | IDNA wrapper, homoglyph normalization, RwLock poisoning | K61-K68: domain fail-closed, confusable collapse, lock safety |
| **Phase 4** (arXiv paper) | Planned | Public documentation of methodology | No new properties |

Most security-critical pure functions now have formal coverage with no trusted
assumptions remaining in the checked suite. The refinement gap between TLA+
model and Rust code is narrower: Verus proves V1-V12 and D1-D6 on
actual Rust, Lean and Coq prove path idempotence at the model level, Kani
bridges the wrapper code with 82 bounded harnesses, and the parity check script
plus filtered parity tests ensure extracted code matches production.

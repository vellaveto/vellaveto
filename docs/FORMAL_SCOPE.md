### Verus Deductive Verification (9 proofs, V1-V8, ALL inputs)

Production code: `vellaveto-engine/src/verified_core.rs`
Verus-annotated: `formal/verus/verified_core.rs`

The `ResolvedMatch` abstraction factors pure verdict computation from
String/HashMap/serde operations. The production code is wired into the
engine evaluation path with `debug_assert` validations confirming the
verified core agrees with every verdict decision. 41 unit tests cover
properties V1-V8 directly.

Verus proves these properties for **ALL** possible inputs via Z3 SMT:

| ID | Property | Verus Status | Test Coverage |
|----|----------|-------------|--------------|
| V1 | Empty -> Deny | Verified | Direct test |
| V2 | All unmatched -> Deny | Verified | Direct test |
| V3 | Allow requires matching policy | Verified | 4 tests |
| V4 | Rule override -> Deny | Verified | 3 tests |
| V5 | Totality (termination) | Verified | Implicit |
| V6 | Priority ordering | Test only | 2 tests |
| V7 | Deny-dominance at equal priority | Test only | Direct test |
| V8 | Conditional pass-through | Verified | 4 tests |

Verification tool: Verus 0.2026.03.01 + Z3 4.12.5. Result: **9 verified, 0 errors.**

### Verus DLP Buffer Arithmetic (`verified_dlp_core.rs`, 14 proofs, D1-D6)

Production code: `vellaveto-mcp/src/inspection/verified_dlp_core.rs`
Verus-annotated: `formal/verus/verified_dlp_core.rs`

Pure buffer arithmetic functions for cross-call DLP, factored from
`cross_call_dlp.rs` for verification. Functions: `extract_tail`,
`can_track_field`, `update_total_bytes`. The production code is called
by `CrossCallDlpTracker::update_buffer()` for all buffer management.
32 unit tests cover D1-D6 directly.

Verus proves these properties for **ALL** possible inputs via Z3 SMT:

| ID | Property | Verus Status | Test Coverage |
|----|----------|-------------|--------------|
| D1 | UTF-8 char boundary safety | Verified | 4 tests |
| D2 | Single buffer size bounded | Verified | 4 tests |
| D3 | Total byte accounting correct | Verified | 3 tests |
| D4 | Capacity check fail-closed | Verified | 4 tests |
| D5 | No arithmetic underflow | Verified | 4 tests |
| D6 | Overlap completeness | Verified | 7 tests |

Proof lemmas: `lemma_continuation_not_boundary` (bit_vector),
`lemma_non_continuation_is_boundary` (bit_vector),
`overlap_completeness_lemma`, `lemma_capacity_fail_closed`,
`lemma_ascii_all_boundaries`.

Verification tool: Verus 0.2026.03.01 + Z3 4.12.5. Result: **14 verified, 0 errors.**

## What Is Tested But Not Formally Verified

These properties are covered by the test suite (8,972+ tests, 24 fuzz targets,
~50 proptest generators) but not by formal specifications:

| Property | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Glob/regex pattern compilation correctness | 24 fuzz targets, ~200 unit tests |
| Path traversal normalization (full impl) | Unit tests + proptest + fuzz |
| DNS rebinding / IP resolution | Unit tests |
| DLP multi-layer decode (base64, percent, combos) | Unit tests + fuzz |
| Injection detection (Aho-Corasick + NFKC + semantic) | Unit tests + fuzz |
| Tool squatting (Levenshtein + homoglyph) | Unit tests |
| Multimodal inspection (PNG/JPEG/PDF/WAV/MP3/MP4/WebM) | Unit tests |
| Audit log rotation and continuity | Unit tests |
| OAuth 2.1 / JWT validation | Unit tests |
| Rate limiting correctness | Unit tests |
| MCP protocol conformance | Integration tests |
| Transport-specific behavior (HTTP/stdio/WS/gRPC) | Integration tests |

---

## What Is Assumed (Not Verified or Tested)

| Assumption | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Ed25519 signature correctness** | Uses `ed25519-dalek`, a widely-audited implementation. Cryptographic primitive verification is outside project scope. |
| **SHA-256 / HMAC-SHA256 correctness** | Uses `ring` (BoringSSL-derived). Same rationale. |
| **Rust memory safety** | No `unsafe` in library code. Relies on the Rust compiler and standard library. |
| **TLS correctness** | TLS termination is handled by upstream infrastructure (nginx, Caddy, cloud LB). |
| **OS filesystem semantics** | `write()` + `fsync()` provide the expected durability guarantees. |
| **Clock monotonicity** | Timestamps use `std::time::Instant` (monotonic) for durations and `SystemTime` for wall clock. NTP jumps could affect wall-clock ordering of audit entries. |
| **DNS resolver correctness** | System DNS resolver returns accurate results. DNS poisoning is mitigated by private-IP blocking but not eliminated. |

---

## Known Abstraction Gaps in Formal Models

| Gap | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Glob patterns abstracted to wildcard + exact | Cannot detect glob-specific matching bugs | 24 fuzz targets cover pattern compilation |
| Path/domain subset uses set identity, not glob matching | Alloy model is more restrictive than Rust implementation | Sound over-approximation (security-safe direction) |
| ABAC CHOOSE vs priority-ordered selection | Reported `policy_id` may differ from Rust | Does not affect Deny/Allow decision |
| Conditional policies simplified to fire/no-fire | Constraint-level deny paths not modeled | Covered by 8,972+ unit tests |
| `RequireApproval` verdict not modeled in TLA+ | Approval flow not formally verified | Covered by integration tests |
| `max_invocations` not checked during attenuation | Child could inherit unlimited invocations | Known implementation gap, tracked |
| Grant subset axiomatized in Lean/Coq | Cannot verify concrete grant coverage | Verified by Alloy bounded model checking |
| Small model bounds (3 policies, 2 actions) | Exhaustive for structural properties | Properties are independent of bound values |

---

## Verification in CI

Formal checks run in CI via `.github/workflows/formal-verification.yml`,
triggered on `formal/**` path changes and weekly schedule:

| Tool | CI Job | Toolchain |
|------|--------|-----------|
| TLA+ (6 specs) | `tla-plus` | Java 21 + tla2tools.jar |
| Lean 4 (5 files) | `lean` | elan + lake |
| Coq (8 files) | `coq` | apt coq package |
| Kani (9 harnesses) | `kani` | cargo-kani + CBMC |
| Verus (23 proofs) | `verus` | Verus 0.2026.03.01 + Z3 4.12.5 |
| Alloy (2 models) | Local only | Requires Alloy Analyzer JAR |

The CI also verifies zero `sorry` (Lean) and zero `Admitted` (Coq) markers.

For local verification: `make formal` (all tools) or `make formal-tla`,
`make formal-lean`, etc. for individual tools. The `make verify` target
includes formal checks when tools are available and skips gracefully
when they are not.

## Relation to Other Verification

| Layer | What It Catches | What It Misses |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Formal specs** | Algorithmic correctness violations across *all* possible inputs | Implementation bugs, concurrency, I/O |
| **Fuzz testing** | Edge cases in parsing, encoding, pattern matching | Algorithmic design flaws |
| **Property tests** | Statistical coverage of invariants | Adversarial inputs (not guided) |
| **Unit tests** | Known-input regression | Novel inputs, emergent behavior |
| **Integration tests** | End-to-end transport/protocol correctness | Performance, scale |

Together, these layers provide defense in depth. No single layer is sufficient.

# Compliance Framework Coverage

> **Version:** 6.0.3

## Overview

VellaVeto maps its runtime security controls to 12 regulatory and industry frameworks. Each framework has a dedicated Rust registry that:

1. **Curates requirements** — articles, clauses, controls, or threat categories from the standard
2. **Maps capabilities** — links VellaVeto features (policy engine, injection detection, DLP, audit, etc.) to each requirement
3. **Generates coverage reports** — per-requirement compliance status with percentages
4. **Produces evidence packs** — structured artifacts for auditor consumption (JSON + HTML)

These are **control mappings**, not certifications. VellaVeto provides the technical controls and evidence artifacts — compliance validation remains deployment-specific and requires assessment by qualified auditors.

## Evidence Packs

Evidence packs are structured compliance artifacts that convert framework coverage reports into auditor-ready documents. Currently available for EU AI Act, NIS2, DORA, and ISO 42001.

### Generation

```rust
use vellaveto_audit::evidence_pack::generate_evidence_pack;
use vellaveto_types::EvidenceFramework;

let pack = generate_evidence_pack(
    EvidenceFramework::Dora,
    "Acme Corp",
    "prod-gateway-01",
);

// Render as HTML
let html = render_evidence_pack_html(&pack);
```

### Via API

```bash
# Generate DORA evidence pack (JSON)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/compliance/evidence-pack/dora

# Generate DORA evidence pack (HTML, print-to-PDF ready)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/compliance/evidence-pack/dora?format=html

# List available evidence pack frameworks
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/compliance/evidence-pack/status

# Generate gap analysis across all frameworks
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/compliance/gap-analysis
```

Available framework path values: `dora`, `nis2`, `iso42001`, `eu-ai-act`

### Pack Contents

Each evidence pack includes:
- **Sections** grouped by regulation chapter/clause/category
- **Items** with compliance status (Compliant / Partial / NotImplemented)
- **Confidence levels** for each item
- **Gaps** with severity and remediation recommendations
- **Overall coverage percentage**
- **Chain-of-custody metadata** (generated_at, organization, system_id)

---

## Cross-Regulation Incident Reporting

A single security incident maps automatically to the notification timelines and requirements of every applicable framework:

| Timeline | Obligation |
|----------|------------|
| **24 hours** | NIS2 pre-notification to CSIRT |
| **72 hours** | NIS2 full notification + DORA incident classification |
| **1 month** | NIS2 final report + EU AI Act risk review |

The `IncidentReport` type captures DORA timeline stages, NIS2 sector classification (essential/important), NIS2 incident type (significant impact, cross-border, supply chain), and EU AI Act obligations (serious incident, systemic risk, rights violation) — enabling a single incident workflow to satisfy all three regulations simultaneously.

**Implementation:** `vellaveto-audit/src/incident_report.rs`

---

## Gap Analysis

The consolidated gap analysis queries all framework registries and produces a unified report:

```rust
use vellaveto_audit::gap_analysis::generate_gap_analysis;

let report = generate_gap_analysis();
// report.overall_coverage_percentage — weighted average across all frameworks
// report.critical_gaps — priority-ranked gaps needing remediation
// report.recommendations — actionable next steps
```

**Implementation:** `vellaveto-audit/src/gap_analysis.rs`

---

## Compliance Presets

Three presets include compliance framework configurations:

| Preset | Frameworks Enabled | Use Case |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| [`compliance-starter.toml`](../examples/presets/compliance-starter.toml) | All 6 configurable (EU AI Act, NIS2, DORA, SOC 2, OWASP ASI, Data Governance) + strict audit | Comprehensive compliance baseline |
| [`financial-agent.toml`](../examples/presets/financial-agent.toml) | DORA, NIS2, SOC 2, EU AI Act | Financial services |
| [`healthcare-agent.toml`](../examples/presets/healthcare-agent.toml) | SOC 2, NIS2 | Healthcare / HIPAA-aligned |

The remaining 6 frameworks (ISO 42001, NIST AI 600-1, CoSAI, Adversa TOP 25, OWASP MCP Top 10, Singapore MGF, CSA ATF) are always-on registries with coverage reports available via the API regardless of configuration.

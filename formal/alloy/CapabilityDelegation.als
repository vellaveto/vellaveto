/**
 * CapabilityDelegation.als — Alloy model for capability token delegation
 *
 * Models the capability-based delegation system from:
 *   vellaveto-mcp/src/capability_token.rs
 *   vellaveto-types/src/capability.rs
 *
 * Verifies 6 safety properties (S11–S16) about monotonic attenuation,
 * delegation depth bounds, temporal monotonicity, and issuer chain integrity.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *   - Time is abstractly modeled with a total order (no real timestamps)
 *   - Pattern matching reduced to Wildcard + Exact (see MCPCommon.tla rationale).
 *     This is conservative: if a property holds with abstract matching (which is
 *     strictly more permissive), it holds with any concrete glob refinement.
 *     Glob-specific bugs are covered by 22 fuzz targets in the Rust codebase.
 *   - MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH reduced to 3 for tractable model checking
 *     (properties are depth-independent; scope 7 > MAX_DEPTH+1 avoids vacuity)
 *   - Structural well-formedness is encoded as facts; delegation protocol
 *     constraints are encoded separately to ensure assertions are non-trivial
 *
 * Known abstraction gaps (not modeled):
 *   - Full glob/regex pattern semantics (abstracted to Wildcard + Exact)
 *   - Ed25519 signature verification (assumes correct cryptographic primitives)
 *   - Path normalization / traversal protection (tested by Rust unit tests)
 *   - MAX_TOKEN_SIZE (65536 bytes) — serialization-level constraint
 *   - max_invocations field — monotonic attenuation now enforced (FIND-FV46-002)
 *   - Token expiry vs. current time — runtime check, not protocol invariant
 *
 * Run with Alloy Analyzer 6:
 *   java -jar org.alloytools.alloy.dist.jar CapabilityDelegation.als
